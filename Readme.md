# Super Resolution

## Previous work 
We start of with model developed by Bee Lim, Sanghyun Son, Heewon Kim, Seungjun Nah, and Kyoung Mu Lee, "Enhanced Deep Residual Networks for Single Image Super-Resolution," 2nd NTIRE: New Trends in Image Restoration and Enhancement workshop and challenge on image super-resolution in conjunction with CVPR 2017.

The original repository is available at [https://github.com/sanghyun-son/EDSR-PyTorch](https://github.com/sanghyun-son/EDSR-PyTorch)

We have clone the repository into the EDSR-PyTorch folder. Commits in this repository may include modifications to the original code.

## Experiments

### Brain MRI image super-resolution
We finetune the EDSR model on the brain MRI image dataset.
